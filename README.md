# Vehicles-In-Action

## User Story 
I want to use an interactive application where I can choose a new or existing vehicle to perform different actions and exit when done.

## Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a command line interface that will process input
<br>
WHEN I want to use a specific vehicle from the choices,
<br>
THEN I choose what I would like to have for my vehicle,
<br>
WHEN I have decided between an existing or new one altogether.
<br>
THEN I will decide the details of what I want my vehicle to be,
<br>
WHEN I proceed to the details portion regardless of previous choices.
<br>
THEN I will decide what action to take with the vehicle of choice.
<br>
WHEN I have picked a new action for each previous one made, 
<br>
THEN I will decide to continue or to exit the application when finished.

## Usage 

The application is a way to use different actions on vehicles that are either a car, motorbike, or truck, and that can then show what each are capable of in real life situations.

## Installation 

The Vehicle in Action application can be launched by inputting the proper commands on the terminal. This will then follow up with a series of questions and prompts to intialize the flow of the user's vehicle in action with the provided details as well.
